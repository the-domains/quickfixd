Welcome to quickfIXd.

A site about simple interaction design fixes.

Take the Jodel app down there. The "+" button placement is so wrong it is just crazy how they missed it in testing.

Less on the 4.7" models but definitly on the 4" models it is EXACTLY there where the user's thumb would hit the screen to start scrolling; activation the button instead. Infuriating.
